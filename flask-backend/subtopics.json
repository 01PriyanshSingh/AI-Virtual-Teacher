This type of reflection is characterized by a soft and blurry image of the object being reflected, and is often seen on surfaces such as paper, cloth, and rough stone."

This type of reflection is characterized by a uniform and matte appearance, and is often seen on surfaces such as matte paint and rough plastics."
