                    "title": "law of reflection diagram",
                    "explanation": "The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. This means that when light hits a surface, it bounces back at the same angle it hit the surface."

                    "explanation": "There are two types of reflection: specular reflection and diffuse reflection. Specular reflection occurs when light hits a smooth surface and bounces back in a uniform way, while diffuse reflection occurs when light hits a rough surface and scatters in different directions."

                    "explanation": "Snell's law states that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction is equal to the ratio of the velocities of the two media. This law is used to predict how light will behave when it passes from one medium to another."
