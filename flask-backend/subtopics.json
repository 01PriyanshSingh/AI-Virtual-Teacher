            "explanation": "Method overloading is a feature in object-oriented programming that allows multiple methods with the same name to be defined, as long as they have different parameter lists. This means that a class can have multiple methods with the same name, but with different numbers or types of parameters."

            "name": "Method Signature",
            "title": "Method Signature in Programming",
            "explanation": "The method signature is a combination of the method name and its parameter list. It is used to identify a method and distinguish it from other methods with the same name. The method signature does not include the return type, so two methods with the same name and parameters but different return types cannot be overloaded."

            "title": "Method Overloading vs Method Overriding in Java",
            "explanation": "Method overloading and method overriding are two different concepts in object-oriented programming. Method overloading occurs when multiple methods with the same name are defined in the same class, while method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass."

            "explanation": "Method overloading can be used in a variety of situations, such as when creating a class that needs to perform different actions based on the input parameters. For example, a `calculateArea` method can be overloaded to accept different types of parameters, such as radius, length and width, or coordinates."

The method in the subclass has the same name, return type, and parameter list as the method in the superclass, but it can have a different implementation."

            "explanation": "There are certain rules that must be followed when overriding a method. The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameter list as the method in the superclass. The method in the subclass must also be public or protected, and it must not be static."

            "name": "Method Overriding Example",
            "title": "Method Overriding in Java Example",
            "explanation": "For example, consider a superclass called 'Animal' that has a method called 'sound()'. A subclass called 'Dog' can override the 'sound()' method to provide its own implementation, such as 'bark()'. When an object of the 'Dog' class is created and the 'sound()' method is called, the 'bark()' method will be executed instead of the 'sound()' method in the 'Animal' class."

            "explanation": "Method overriding provides several benefits, including increased flexibility and customization. It allows subclasses to provide their own implementation of a method, which can be useful when the superclass method is not suitable for the subclass. It also promotes code reuse, as the subclass can inherit the common attributes and methods from the superclass and add its own specific implementation."

For example, in a banking system, a 'CheckingAccount' class can override the 'withdraw()' method of the 'Account' class to provide its own implementation of withdrawal rules."
